=================

SkyDrive shortcut for the desktop tray that we made during the University Hacker Olympics hackathon in San Francisco, California.

SkyDrive Shortcut is a desktop application that sits in the notification area of the taskbar. The user can click the icon or move the mouse to the top left of their screen to open up the shortcut window. Files can be dragged & dropped or pasted while the window is in focus to upload them to SkyDrive. SkyDrive Shortcut also supports pasting plain text which will create a .txt file on SkyDrive.

When the upload is complete a notification bubble will appear above the desktop icon. A shortened url to a read-only version of the file is automatically copied to the users clipboard.

Settings can be found by right clicking on the icon.
